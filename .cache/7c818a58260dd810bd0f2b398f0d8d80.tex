\\
\midrule
AD-01 & Autonomous Target Recognition & Function & None: User tasks the satellite, and the user determines if there is a fire in the optical image & Task-Based: The user tasks the satellite to collect data for a particular region, but onboard processing determines if there is a fire present in the optical image. & Continuous: The satellite continuously gathers images without being explicitly tasked and continuously monitors for fire detection & 
\\
\midrule
AD-02 & Data Path & Form to function & Stand-Alone Direct to Ground & Internal Relay Mesh (Use Only own constellation Sat) & LEO-LEO External Relay Mesh (User Other Sat Providers Sat) & LEO-GEO External Relay
\\
\midrule
AD-03 & Information Downlinked & Form & Full Image & Snippet /Thumbnail & Metadata Only (Yes/No Logic, Lat/Long, Fire Area) & 
\\
\midrule
AD-04.1 & Uplink (TT\&C) Communication Technology & Form to function & Optical Laser & X-Band Radio Frequency & Ka-Band Radio Frequency & 
\\
\midrule
AD-04.2 & Data Downlink Communication Technology & Form to function & Optical Laser & X-Band Radio Frequency & Ka-Band Radio Frequency & None (if using external relay)
\\
\midrule
AD-04.3 & Inter-satellite Communication Technology & Form to function & Optical Laser & X-Band Radio Frequency & Ka-Band Radio Frequency & None (if not performing meshing/relaying)
\\
\midrule
AD-05 & Data Routing Protocol & Form to function & Static/Scheduled: Data path from acquiring satellite to ground is static and defined upfront & Dynamic Mesh: Data path from acquiring satellite to ground is dynamic, can be routed through different satellites and can account for/adapt to the current state of the nodes in the network (availability, capacity, positioning, etc). & Store and Forward: Like dynamic mesh, but can exploit the future appearance of links between nodes due to changes in satellite's position (by temporarily storing data onboard before forwarding). Requires onboard storage facility and knowledge of the orbital parameters of the participating nodes for route planning purposes. &
