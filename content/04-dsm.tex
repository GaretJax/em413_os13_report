\lchapter{Decisions Coupling}

% Identify the coupling of each decision by creating a DSM of the decisions, and counting the number of other decisions that relate as a measure of coupling. You can think of coupling as if Decision A was changed from Option 1 to Option 2, would it force a revisitation of Decision B’s choice of options? (1 slide or 1 page) [20%]

% Rubric
% Excellent (20 to >14.0 pts): Clear coupling provided for each decision and discussion of the method used to assert the coupling, supported by a DSM diagram with excellent graphical representation. Insights are provided regarding what the coupling means in terms of how the team plans to approach the architectural decisions in downstream processes.
% Very Good (14 to >7.0 pts): Coupling is provided for each decision, but there are questions about how the score was arrived at. DSM and analysis have minor errors and inconsistencies.
% Good (7 to >0 pts): Coupling is missing or has major inconsistencies. DSM exhibits many graphical or technical errors. See TA feedback.

% Failure modes
% * Decisions are missing from the list
% * DSM has different axes
% * Decisions are marked as "coupled", but their source of coupling is not identified
% * Coupling is identified on the basis of proximity or surface contact, without asserting how or why
% * Very few couplings are identified
% * Most decisions are coupled to most others (failure to define a level of abstraction at which the coupling analysis is a meaningful discriminator)
% * All decisions are tied back to a single variable (e.g., everything influences cost, so everything is coupled)
% * Connectivity is confused with sensitivity
