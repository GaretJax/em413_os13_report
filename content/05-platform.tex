\lchapter[platform]{Platform Strategy}

% 5. (25%) Reflect on the discussion of product platforms as it relates to your project.
% Do you foresee having to develop a product platform with multiple products (or configurations) to be successful?
% If so, articulate your platform strategy based on the 8-step framework (the first two columns of the Platform Flight Plan from SA13 and SA14).
% If not, comment on why one product is more appropriate for your market(s), comment on how the rates of technological change for important technologies used in your system will impact your architectural stability, and how you would approach product / system evolution. [1 page]

%   - No discussion of what variety is demanded by the market, what variety is not demanded by the market or why that variety cannot be served without a platform strategy
%   - Attempting to cover the whole market (should cover segments, not the whole market)
%   - Citing both cost savings and revenue as strategic goals
%   - Platform strategy framed as a "best practice"
%   - No discussion of the investment required for the platform or the drawbacks that would be required (platform premium, overperformance, etc).
% * If the team didn't choose a platform strategy:
%   - No explanation of why
%   - No discussion of what variety is demanded by the market
%   - No discussion of architectural stability
