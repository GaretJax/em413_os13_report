\lchapter[past-designs]{Past Design Solutions}

% 2. (10%) Show three past design solutions (systems that were built and sold) for your problem space, and which options they picked for your architectural decisions.
% Include, if applicable, the currently available for purchase solution that your system design might improve upon as one of the three.
% Illustrate each past design solution in the Q1 morphological matrix, to show how the 3 solutions differ based on your architectural decisions. [1 page]

% Rubric
% Q2: Framing Past Designs
% Excellent (4 to >3.0 pts): Clearly frames past designs using a structured list of architectural decisions.
% Very Good (3 to >2.0 pts): Discusses past designs but partially lacks architectural framing.
% Good (2 to >0 pts): Mentions past designs but weakly connects them to architectural decisions.
%
% Q2: Key Differences Between Past Designs
% Excellent (4 to >3.0 pts): Correctly distinguishes between design changes and major architectural shifts in the new proposed designs compared to a past design
% Very Good (3 to >2.0 pts): Occasionally misclassifies minor design changes as architectural.
% Good (2 to >0 pts): see comments from grader
%
% Q2: Proposed Improvements
% Excellent (2 to >1.0 pts): Clearly articulates major architectural differences between past designs and how proposed system could improve upon past systems
% Very Good (1 to >0.5 pts): Includes discussion about how proposed system could improve upon past designs, but does not cleary relate differences to identified architecture choices.
% Good (0.5 to >0 pts): See comments from grader

% Failure modes
% * No framing of past designs using a list of architectural decisions.
% * No reflection on the Product / System as a member of one class of architecture.
% * No articulation of how the future solutions may improve past designs.
% * Misclassification of small (design-level) changes between past designs as architectural.
