\lchapter[decisions]{Architectural Decisions}

% Define a set of candidate architectural decisions for your system (no more than 10 decisions), with mutually exclusive options for each decision. Try to be as specific as possible to your problem. Make sure that each decision is technical, in the company’s control, and that you are showing technical choices to be made (1,2,3 backup generators), not inputs or scope choices (will it be used off-grid?), or outcomes (reliability of 99%). For each decision, identify whether it is a decision on form, function, or form to function mapping.A (1 slide or 1 page) [25%]

% Rubric
% Excellent (25 to >18.0 pts): Identified a list of architectural decisions that encompass the scope of the intended system, defined mutually exclusive options for each decision, and properly classified each decision to form, function, or form-to-function mapping, with a balance of decisions that relate to form, function, and form-to-function mapping. Clearly shows that decisions are capable of generating many valid and alternative architectures. Provides rationale for the decisions, options, and classifications.
% Very Good (18 to >9.0 pts): Provided solid architectural decisions and descriptions with minor errors in terms of not mutually exclusive options, outcomes listed as decisions, or goals listed as decisions.
% Good (9 to >0 pts): Provided decisions that are not true technical architectural decisions or missing crucial decisions for the intended system. Improper options for each decision are listed or errors in decision classification. See TA feedback.

% Failure modes
% * Decisions are not “architectural” (e.g., "color", "leather/cloth", and "wheel diameter" for a car)
% * Decisions relate to a process, not the architecture (a set of technical design decisions, the "how" that accomplishes the requirements/goals)
% * Decisions are applied to non-technical aspects. NOTE: The word architecture is reserved for technical consideration, and excludes business process, organizational decisions, etc.
% * Almost all the decisions are about form (less likely to be architectural)
% * Very few or no decisions are about form-function mapping
% * Function decisions are mis-categorized as form decisions, or vice versa
% * Options are not mutually exclusive or are awkwardly framed so as to make them mutually exclusive
% * Architectural decisions are mixed with scope, scenarios, intent, goals, metrics, or requirements (e.g., choosing a price point for the system)
% * An outcome of the system (emergence) is confused with architectural decisions (e.g., “should it be easy to use or not”, “should it be efficient or not”)
% * More than 10 decisions are provided
% * Decisions are not sensitive or connected
% * Decisions are not within the architect’s control
