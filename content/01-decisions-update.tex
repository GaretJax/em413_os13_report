\lchapter[decisions-update]{Updated Architectural Decisions}

% 1. (10%) Update your list of architectural decisions from OS11, identifying which decisions have already been made, which decisions remain, and any new decisions that may have been identified.
% Explain each and summarize why your final set of decisions satisfies the problem space (i.e., your SPS).
% Show your decisions as table (aka morphological matrix) [1 page]

% Rubric
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Architectural Focus
% Excellent (3 to >2.5 pts): All decisions are technical and architectural in nature (excluding process, form-based, or business-related decisions). There is a strong mapping between form and function, with no misclassified decisions.
% Very Good (2.5 to >1.5 pts): 1-2 minor process or form-based decisions are included or 1-2 architectural decisions are misclassified.
% Good (1.5 to >0 pts): More than 3 non-architectural decisions are present (e.g., related to process, business, aesthetics) or more than 3 architectural decisions are influenced by form.
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Justifications
% Excellent (3 to >2.5 pts): There must be a clear, explicit rationale explaining how existing decisions satisfy the SPS. Explanations for closed decisions are clear, and any remaining or newly identified decisions have appropriate rationale.
% Very Good (2.5 to >1.5 pts): Only some updates are explained, or does not cleary express how existing decisions satisfy the SPS.
% Good (1.5 to >0 pts): See comments from grader
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Trade-offs & Emergence
% Excellent (2 to >1.0 pts): All decisions represent mutually exclusive trade-offs focused on architecture rather than just system properties (like usability).
% Very Good (1 to >0.5 pts): Minor overlaps exist among decisions, with some references to emergent properties.
% Good (0.5 to >0 pts): Confuses system outcomes (e.g., usability) with architectural decisions. See comments from grader
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Morphological Matrix
% Excellent (2 to >1.0 pts): Decisions are clearly represented in morphological matrix.
% Very Good (1 to >0.5 pts): Morphological matrix is provided but contains ambiguity or incorrect formatting.
% Good (0.5 to >0 pts): see comments from grader

% Failure modes
% * Decisions are selected that no one would reasonably call "architectural" (e.g., color, leather, wheel diameter)
% * Decisions relate to a process, not the architecture.
% * Decisions applied to non-technical aspects.
% * Too many decisions focus on form; very few/no decisions on form-function mapping.
% * Misclassification of function decisions as form decisions or vice versa.
% * If architectural decisions were made since the list in OS11, no explanation of the rationale for those decisions.
% * Options are not mutually exclusive or awkwardly framed to make them appear so.
% * Confusing an outcome of the system (emergence) with architectural decisions (e.g., "should it be easy to use or not ").
% * Mixing architectural decisions with scope, scenarios, intent, goals, metrics, or requirements.
% * Decisions that aren't within the architect's control.
% * Decisions aren't sensitive or connected.
% * Too many decisions to possibly all be architectural in nature (e.g., more than 10).

\vspace{0.5em}
After speaking with our sponsors since OS11, we have moved Orbit and Ground Segment from fixed assumptions to architectural decisions (AD-06/07) to better address end-to-end latency.  Additional feedback and discussion with our sponsor led us to update AD-04.1 (Uplink Comms) from Ka-Band to S/X-band in order to prioritize link reliability over data size for uplink. Further, our architectural decision set has been refined to better reflect the structural drivers required to satisfy our SPS. The most consequential update is elevating the data path (AD-02) to the architectural anchor. 
SPS Justification:
Data Volume Reduction (AD-01, AD-03): These ADs satisfy the “low-latency” requirement by minimizing the number of bits transmitted, thereby bypassing bandwidth bottlenecks.
Network Optimization: (AD-02, AD-05, AD-06): These ADs enable “bypassing terrestrial infrastructure limitations” by using an adaptive mesh and strategic ground entry points to find the fastest path to the end-user.
Persistent Coverage (AD-07): Satisfies the “persistent” requirement of the SPS by selecting an orbital shell that ensures constant satellite availability over target areas. 

The identified architectural decisions (AD-01 through AD-07) represent the complete set of technical levers required to satisfy the SPS. No additional architectural lever meaningfully influences latency without falling into implementation detail. Therefore, this set is sufficient to bound the tradespace while avoiding premature technology commitment. To achieve low-latency, the architecture allows for trading on-board processing levels (AD-01, AD-03) to minimize data volume before it ever hits the downlink bottleneck. To bypass terrestrial limitations, the tradespace includes multiple networking and routing configurations (AD-02, AD-05) that enable the system to find the optimal path to the end-user, regardless of local ground station availability. Persistence is addressed by making the orbital shell and ground network architecture explicit decisions (AD-07, AD-06); this allows the team to optimize the geometric relationship between satellites and ground entry points to minimize "waiting time". Finally, by treating uplink communication (AD-04.1) as an open decision focused on S/X-Band reliability over raw speed, the architecture ensures the persistent availability of the command-and-control link under diverse atmospheric conditions. Collectively, these open decisions provide the necessary degrees of freedom to converge on a design that satisfies the rigorous latency and persistence requirements of the project. Therefore, at this stage, most decisions remain open as the team enters tradespace exploration.
