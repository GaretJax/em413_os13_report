\lchapter[decisions-update]{Updated Architectural Decisions}

% 1. (10%) Update your list of architectural decisions from OS11, identifying which decisions have already been made, which decisions remain, and any new decisions that may have been identified.
% Explain each and summarize why your final set of decisions satisfies the problem space (i.e., your SPS).
% Show your decisions as table (aka morphological matrix) [1 page]

% Rubric
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Architectural Focus
% Excellent (3 to >2.5 pts): All decisions are technical and architectural in nature (excluding process, form-based, or business-related decisions). There is a strong mapping between form and function, with no misclassified decisions.
% Very Good (2.5 to >1.5 pts): 1-2 minor process or form-based decisions are included or 1-2 architectural decisions are misclassified.
% Good (1.5 to >0 pts): More than 3 non-architectural decisions are present (e.g., related to process, business, aesthetics) or more than 3 architectural decisions are influenced by form.
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Justifications
% Excellent (3 to >2.5 pts): There must be a clear, explicit rationale explaining how existing decisions satisfy the SPS. Explanations for closed decisions are clear, and any remaining or newly identified decisions have appropriate rationale.
% Very Good (2.5 to >1.5 pts): Only some updates are explained, or does not cleary express how existing decisions satisfy the SPS.
% Good (1.5 to >0 pts): See comments from grader
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Trade-offs & Emergence
% Excellent (2 to >1.0 pts): All decisions represent mutually exclusive trade-offs focused on architecture rather than just system properties (like usability).
% Very Good (1 to >0.5 pts): Minor overlaps exist among decisions, with some references to emergent properties.
% Good (0.5 to >0 pts): Confuses system outcomes (e.g., usability) with architectural decisions. See comments from grader
%
% Q1: Updated Decisions: Morphological Matrix
% Excellent (2 to >1.0 pts): Decisions are clearly represented in morphological matrix.
% Very Good (1 to >0.5 pts): Morphological matrix is provided but contains ambiguity or incorrect formatting.
% Good (0.5 to >0 pts): see comments from grader

% Failure modes
% * Decisions are selected that no one would reasonably call "architectural" (e.g., color, leather, wheel diameter)
% * Decisions relate to a process, not the architecture.
% * Decisions applied to non-technical aspects.
% * Too many decisions focus on form; very few/no decisions on form-function mapping.
% * Misclassification of function decisions as form decisions or vice versa.
% * If architectural decisions were made since the list in OS11, no explanation of the rationale for those decisions.
% * Options are not mutually exclusive or awkwardly framed to make them appear so.
% * Confusing an outcome of the system (emergence) with architectural decisions (e.g., "should it be easy to use or not ").
% * Mixing architectural decisions with scope, scenarios, intent, goals, metrics, or requirements.
% * Decisions that aren't within the architect's control.
% * Decisions aren't sensitive or connected.
% * Too many decisions to possibly all be architectural in nature (e.g., more than 10).
