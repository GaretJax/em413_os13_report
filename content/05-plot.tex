\lchapter[plot]{Connectivity vs Sensitivity}

%Plot your decisions in the connectivity vs. sensitivity space. Identify which of your candidate decisions are most “architectural”. Create an ordering of architectural decisions, from most architectural (most coupled, most sensitive) to least architectural (least coupled, least sensitive). Feel free to identify coupling or parallel paths in the decision ordering, as shown in Ch 15 p355 Figure 15.16, or do it using your own rationale. (0.5 slide or page) [10%]

% Rubric
% Excellent (10 to >7.0 pts): The sequencing plan for making architectural decisions is clearly laid out and strongly supported by a connectivity vs sensitivity space consistent with Q1-4 OS11 questions. Provides great insights into what architectural decisions should/can be made in parallel. Clear systems thinking and insights on milestones that will enable architectural decisions to be made.
% Very Good (7 to >3.0 pts): Sequencing plan or connectivity vs sensitivity space shows a logical plan forward with minor errors or inconsistencies.
% Good (3 to >0 pts): Major inconsistencies or errors in generating the connectivity vs sensitivity space and subsequently faulty plan for order in which decisions should be made. See TA feedback.

% Failure modes
% * All decisions are highly coupled and highly sensitive
% * Similar decisions have vastly different placement on the connectivity vs. sensitivity space
% * Decisions seem unreasonably uniformly distributed through the four quadrants
% * Decisions are placed in only "sensitive and strongly connected" and "insensitive and weakly connected"
% * Ordering of architectural decisions is not reasonable (seemingly simple decisions are ranked more architectural than others)
